## Setup Instructions
For the best experience, use docker to start up environment by running the command below in the root of your project
```bash 
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
``` 
The command above launches the website on http://localhost

Alternatively, If you have all the requirements, you can use laravel built-in server by running:

```bash 
php artisan serve --port 90
``` 
This command means you will launch the website on http://localhost:90



Regards.
